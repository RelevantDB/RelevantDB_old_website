Careers at RelevantDB

<p class="pagesubhead">
Senior software developer<br/>
Chicago, Illinois <br/>
Onsite or remote
</p>

<p>
We are developing a particular type of NewSQL database designed to run on the JVM.
</p>
<p>
We're looking for people with several years of software development experience, particularly around creating database 
engines or search engines. We're looking for experience with at least some of the following: distributed systems, compilers 
and parser-generators, internal database design, various index types and strategies, compression, kv stores (design and usage), 
networking and low-level communications libraries, consensus algorithms, and natural language processing. A bit of machine 
learning wouldn't hurt.
</p> 
<p>
No one will be an expert in all (or even most) of these things, but if you've read "Designing Data-Intensive 
Applications" and already knew much of what was in there, we'd like to talk to you.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Silicon Valley, we do not discriminate based on age. Experience matters. We hire old people. (And young people, too.)
</p>
<p>
Principals only; no recruiters. Email <a href="#">cvsubmit /at/ relevantdb /dot/ com</a>.
